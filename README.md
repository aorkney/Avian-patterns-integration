# Avian-patterns-integration

 This repository hosts scripts to perform the analyses presented in Orkney et al., 2021 'Patterns of integration...'
 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-021-01509-w

 These scripts have been updated to work with R version 4.2.3 
 Some results may have changed slightly, primarily as a result of updates to the analytical packages 'geomorph' and 'nlme'. 
 The major conclsuions of the analysis remain unchanged.
